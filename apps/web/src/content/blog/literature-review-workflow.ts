# Literature Review Workflow: From Discovery to Citation

Literature reviews are overwhelming—hundreds of papers, countless citations, months of work. Here's a systematic workflow that works.

## The Literature Review Challenge

You need to:
- Find relevant research across databases
- Track what you've read vs. need to read
- Extract key findings
- Identify gaps and themes
- Maintain proper citations
- Synthesize everything coherently

Traditional approaches don't scale past 20-30 papers.

## The Five-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Discovery & Collection

**Search Strategies**:
- Academic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, JSTOR)
- Citation chaining (follow references)
- Related work sections
- Key author publications

**Capture Everything**:
Use PageStash to save:
- Full paper pages (before they go behind paywalls)
- Abstract pages with metadata
- Author profiles
- Related research listings

One-click capture means zero friction. Capture first, filter later.

### Stage 2: Initial Screening

**First Pass** (2 min per paper):
- Read abstract
- Scan introduction and conclusion
- Check methodology
- Decide: Include, Maybe, Exclude

Tag immediately:
- #include, #maybe, #exclude
- #methodology-quantitative, #methodology-qualitative
- #highly-relevant, #background-only

### Stage 3: Deep Reading & Annotation

**Second Pass** (30-60 min per paper):

For included papers:
1. Full read
2. Highlight key passages
3. Extract main findings
4. Note methodology strengths/weaknesses
5. Identify how it relates to your research

**Organization by Theme**:
As patterns emerge, tag by theme:
- #theme-theoretical-framework
- #theme-methodology-debate
- #theme-empirical-findings
- #gap-identified

PageStash's knowledge graphs automatically show connections between papers.

### Stage 4: Synthesis

**Matrix Method**:

Create comparison matrix:
- Authors | Year | Method | Key Findings | Limitations | Relevance

Build this from your tagged and annotated captures—all source material one search away.

**Thematic Analysis**:

Group papers by theme:
1. What are researchers saying about X?
2. Where do they agree?
3. Where do they conflict?
4. What's missing?

Use PageStash's tag filtering to view all papers by theme.

### Stage 5: Citation Management

**Proper Attribution**:

For each paper, capture:
- Full citation (use Zotero/Mendeley for automation)
- Page numbers for specific quotes
- Original context for paraphrasing

PageStash captures complete pages—always have the source when you need to verify.

**Integration with Citation Managers**:

**Zotero**: Best for academics
**Mendeley**: Good for collaboration
**PageStash**: Captures what citation managers miss (web-based research, grey literature, blog posts)

Use both: Citation manager for papers, PageStash for everything else.

## The Weekly Workflow

**Monday** (2 hours): New paper discovery and capture
**Tuesday-Thursday** (3-4 hours): Deep reading sessions
**Friday** (2 hours): Synthesis and matrix updates

Consistency beats intensity—steady progress adds up.

## Organization Structure

**By Review Stage**:
- 1-Discovery (new finds, not yet screened)
- 2-Screening (reading abstracts)
- 3-Included (full reading in progress)
- 4-Read (completed, ready for synthesis)
- 5-Excluded (not relevant)

**By Theme** (emerges during reading):
- Theoretical frameworks
- Methodological approaches
- Empirical findings
- Debates and controversies
- Research gaps

**By Source Type**:
- Peer-reviewed journals
- Conference papers
- Books and chapters
- Grey literature
- Web-based research

## Search and Retrieval

Full-text search across all captured papers:

"What did researchers say about methodology X?"
"Who cited Author Y's framework?"
"Which papers identified gap Z?"

Instant answers from hundreds of papers.

## Collaboration

**For Thesis/Dissertation**:
- Share relevant folders with advisors
- Tag items for discussion
- Export annotated collections

**For Team Projects**:
- Collaborative folders
- Consistent tagging system
- Shared synthesis documents

## Common Literature Review Mistakes

❌ Starting to write before finishing reading
❌ Not tracking source citations properly
❌ Linear reading (paper by paper) instead of thematic
❌ Keeping every paper (be selective)
❌ No systematic organization system

## The Literature Review Timeline

**Month 1**: Discovery and initial screening (100-200 papers → 40-60)
**Month 2**: Deep reading and annotation (40-60 papers)
**Month 3**: Synthesis and matrix building
**Month 4**: Writing and citing

Adjust based on scope, but stay systematic.

## Tools for Academic Success

**Paper Discovery**: Google Scholar, databases
**Citation Management**: Zotero, Mendeley
**Web Archiving**: PageStash (captures papers, web research, grey lit)
**Writing**: Word, LaTeX, Google Docs
**Analysis**: Matrix spreadsheets

Together, they form a complete system.

## From Literature Review to Contribution

Your review should reveal:
- What we know (existing research)
- What we don't know (gaps)
- Why it matters (significance)
- What you'll contribute (your research)

A systematic capture and organization system makes this analysis possible.

## Your Action Plan

**Week 1**:
- Set up folder structure
- Create tag taxonomy
- Begin systematic capture

**Weeks 2-8**:
- Discovery and screening
- Deep reading and annotation
- Matrix building

**Weeks 9-12**:
- Synthesis
- Draft writing
- Citation verification
