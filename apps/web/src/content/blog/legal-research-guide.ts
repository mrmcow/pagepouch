# Legal Research: Managing Case Law and Web Sources

Legal research demands precision, organization, and verifiable sources. Here's how to manage web-based legal research effectively.

## The Legal Research Challenge

Modern legal work requires:
- Tracking case law developments
- Monitoring regulatory changes
- Competitor analysis
- Client research
- Industry intelligence

And you need to find everything again, instantly, with proper attribution.

## Archiving for Legal Work

### Why Full-Page Capture Matters

**Evidence Preservation**: Websites change or disappear
**Date Stamping**: Prove when content existed
**Attribution**: Maintain proper source documentation
**Compliance**: Meet documentation requirements

Bookmarks aren't enough. Screenshots lose context. You need complete archival.

## Organization Framework

### By Matter/Case

Create folders for each active matter:
- Case law research
- Regulatory materials
- Expert publications
- Competitor information
- Client industry research

### By Research Type

Tag by category:
- Precedent (cases)
- Statutes and regulations
- Expert commentary
- News and developments
- Background research

### By Jurisdiction

Critical for legal work:
- Federal vs. State
- Circuit/District
- International
- Regulatory body

Multi-tag items that span jurisdictions.

## The Research Workflow

### Daily Legal News Monitoring

**Morning Routine** (30 min):
- Legal news sites
- Regulatory updates
- Practice area developments
- Capture and tag immediately

### Active Matter Research

When working a case:
1. Comprehensive initial research
2. Capture all relevant sources
3. Tag with matter number + category
4. Add context notes
5. Maintain proper citations

### Competitive Intelligence

For firm development:
- Competitor case outcomes
- Market positioning
- Practice area focus
- Attorney movements

## Citation Management

Add detailed notes:
- **Proper citation format**
- **Key holdings or quotes**
- **Relevance to matter**
- **Reliability assessment**

This transforms captures into usable research assets.

## Search Requirements

Legal research demands precision:
- Find specific cases instantly
- Search within jurisdiction
- Filter by date range
- Full-text search for specific language

### Document Retention

Check your jurisdiction's requirements:

### Confidentiality

Separate:
- Privileged materials
- Work product
- Public research
- Client confidential information

Use appropriate security measures for sensitive research.
