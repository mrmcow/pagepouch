# The GTD Method for Web Content

David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD) transformed personal productivity. Here's how to apply it specifically to web content management.

## The GTD Promise

"Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them." This applies doubly to web content—you can't remember 500 articles.

## The Five Steps of GTD

### 1. Capture

Everything that catches your attention goes into your system:

**For Web Content**:
- Interesting articles
- Research materials  
- Background reading
- Reference documents
- Inspiration

Use PageStash's extension: one click captures the complete page. No friction = consistent capture habit.

### 2. Clarify

Process your captures:

**Is it actionable?**
- Yes → What's the next action?
- No → Reference, Someday/Maybe, or Trash

**For Most Web Content**: It's reference material

**Ask**: "Why did I save this?"
- For current project → Tag with project
- For background knowledge → File in appropriate area
- For someday reading → Someday/Maybe folder
- Can't remember? → Delete it

### 3. Organize

GTD's organizing principle for reference material:

**Projects**: Active work (complete within year)
**Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities
**Resources**: Topics of interest
**Archives**: Completed or inactive

**Example Structure**:
- Projects/Q4-Marketing-Campaign
- Areas/Competitive-Intelligence
- Resources/Design-Inspiration
- Archive/2024-Completed

Keep it simple. Complex hierarchies break down.

### 4. Reflect

**Weekly Review** (30-60 min):

Review this week's captures:
- Still relevant? Keep it
- Used it? Archive or delete
- Needs action? Create task
- Reveals pattern? Note it

Without review, your system becomes a pile of stuff.

**Monthly Review** (90 min):

- Clean up quick-capture inbox
- Archive completed projects
- Update your organization structure
- Celebrate what you've learned

### 5. Engage

Use your system with confidence:

Need something? Search and find it instantly
Working on project? All materials in one place
Making decision? All context at hand

## Web-Specific GTD Techniques

### The Inbox Workflow

Save everything to Inbox initially. Weekly review processes it:

1. Open each capture
2. Ask: "What is this? Why does it matter?"
3. Tag and move to proper location
4. Add context notes if needed
5. Link to related items

Process to zero weekly.

### The Reference System

Most web content is reference material:

**Active Reference**: Current projects, frequent access
**Background Reference**: General knowledge, occasional use
**Archive**: Historical, rare access

PageStash's search means deep archives stay accessible.

### The Read/Review Lists

**Read/Review** folder for:
- Articles saved for reading
- Research to summarize
- Content to extract insights from

Process regularly—don't let it become a guilt pile.

Set realistic goals: 3-5 articles per week, not 50.

### The Someday/Maybe Folder

Interesting but not urgent:
- Topics to explore someday
- Possible future projects
- Inspiration to revisit

Review quarterly. Delete ruthlessly.

## GTD Horizons for Web Content

**Horizon 5**: Life purpose
→ What knowledge truly matters?

**Horizon 4**: Long-term vision (3-5 years)
→ What expertise am I building?

**Horizon 3**: 1-2 year goals
→ What research supports my goals?

**Horizon 2**: Areas of focus
→ What topics do I track ongoing?

**Horizon 1**: Current projects
→ What research do I need now?

**Ground**: Current actions
→ What needs processing today?

Align your web content system with your horizons.

## The Two-Minute Rule

If processing a saved page will take less than 2 minutes, do it now:
- Quick read → Extract key insight, archive or delete
- Simple reference → Tag and file immediately
- Clear not relevant → Delete

Don't defer what's faster to do.

## Staying Current vs. Collecting

GTD is about trusted system, not perfect system:

**Collect freely**: Zero friction to capture
**Process ruthlessly**: Delete what doesn't serve you
**Organize simply**: Find fast, not perfect categories
**Review regularly**: System stays current
**Use confidently**: Trust your system has what you need

## Common GTD Mistakes

❌ Over-organizing instead of using
❌ Skipping weekly review (system becomes stale)
❌ Keeping everything (hoarder's guilt)
❌ Complex tagging schemes (simple wins)
❌ Not trusting your system (defeats the purpose)

## GTD Tools for Web Content

**For Capture**: PageStash extension (frictionless)
**For Organization**: Folders + tags (simple scales)
**For Search**: Full-text search (find anything instantly)
**For Review**: Weekly ritual (30-60 min blocked time)

## Integration with Complete GTD System

PageStash complements your task manager:

**Task Manager**: Actions, projects, next steps
**Page Pouch**: Reference materials, research, background

They work together—tasks reference saved content.

## Start Your GTD Web System

**Week 1**:
- Set up PARA folders (Projects/Areas/Resources/Archive)
- Start capturing to Inbox
- Schedule weekly review

**Week 2**:
- Process Inbox to zero
- Tag and organize captures
- Refine your structure

**Month 2**:
- System becomes habit
- Trust builds
- Mind clears

## The GTD Promise Fulfilled

When your web content system works:

✅ Clear mind (externalized into trusted system)
✅ Fast retrieval (find anything in seconds)
✅ Confident decisions (all context at hand)
✅ Stress-free productivity (no "what am I forgetting?")
