# Content Creator's Research System: Never Lose an Idea

**Great content starts with great research.**

But most creators treat research like this:
- Screenshot random stuff
- Save to "Inspo" folder
- Never look at it again
- Panic when it's time to create

**There's a better way.**

## The Creator's Research Problem

### The Chaos:

**200 screenshots** on your phone
**50 open browser tabs** "for later"
**Bookmarks** you'll never find again
**Notes app** full of random ideas
**Desktop folder** called "Content Ideas"

**Result**: Creative block when you need to create.

### The Solution:

**One system. Four categories. Instant access.**
