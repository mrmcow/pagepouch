# The 5-Minute Research Capture System

**No time for complex organization? This system takes 5 minutes to learn and 30 seconds per source to use.**

Perfect for busy professionals who need results without the overhead.

## The Core Principle

**Capture now, organize minimally, find instantly.**

That's it. Three actions, done fast.

## The 5-Minute Setup

### Minute 1-2: Create Three Folders

**Work/**
**Personal/**
**Reference/**

Done. That's your folder structure.

### Minute 3-4: Define Five Tags

Pick your five most common themes. Examples:

- Important
- To-read
- Active-project
- Reference
- Ideas

### Minute 5: Install PageStash

[Install the browser extension](/auth/signup). One click. Done.

**Total setup time: 5 minutes**

---

üí° **Quick Tip**: That's literally all the setup you need. [Start now](/auth/signup) and capture your first source in 30 seconds.

## The 30-Second Capture Ritual

**When you find something valuable:**

**Step 1 (5 seconds)**: Click extension, content saves automatically

**Step 2 (10 seconds)**: Add one folder (Work/Personal/Reference)

**Step 3 (10 seconds)**: Add one or two tags

**Step 4 (5 seconds)**: Optional: Add why you saved it (5 words max)

**Total: 30 seconds**

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Marketing Professional

**Found**: Competitor analysis article

**Capture**:
- Folder: Work
- Tags: competitors, strategy
- Note: "Q4 campaign ideas"
- **Time**: 25 seconds

### Example 2: Student

**Found**: Research paper for essay

**Capture**:
- Folder: Work
- Tags: essay-topic, to-read
- Note: "Supports argument 2"
- **Time**: 30 seconds

### Example 3: Content Creator

**Found**: Inspiration article

**Capture**:
- Folder: Personal
- Tags: ideas, content
- Note: "Video idea"
- **Time**: 20 seconds

## The Search-First Workflow

**Don't organize more, search better.**

Instead of complex folders:
- Save everything to three simple folders
- Tag with 1-2 relevant tags
- Use full-text search to find anything

**Finding content:**
1. Remember a keyword from the article
2. Search PageStash
3. Find it in seconds

**This beats scrolling through 20 folders.**

## Why This Works

**Traditional organization:**
- 15+ folders
- Complex hierarchy
- Decision fatigue
- Takes 2+ minutes per source
- Result: You stop using it

**5-Minute System:**
- 3 folders
- 5 tags
- No thinking required
- Takes 30 seconds
- Result: You actually use it

## Advanced (Still Quick) Techniques

### The Status Tag Method

Add one status tag:
- new (just saved)
- active (working with it)
- done (used it)

**Benefit**: See what needs attention vs. what's complete.

### The Project Tag

Working on a specific project? Create one project tag:
- project-website-redesign
- project-thesis
- project-quarterly-report

**Benefit**: See everything for that project across all folders.

### The Weekly 5-Minute Review

**Every Friday, 5 minutes:**
1. Search tag: "new"
2. Quick scan what you saved
3. Delete obvious junk
4. Update tags if needed
5. Done

**Keeps system clean with minimal effort.**

## Common Questions

**Q: Only 3 folders? Really?**
A: Yes. Tags handle the complexity. Folders are just broad categories.

**Q: What if I need more organization?**
A: Add more tags, not folders. Tags are flexible, folders are rigid.

**Q: Won't search be slow with everything mixed together?**
A: No. PageStash full-text search is instant, even with thousands of items.

**Q: What about different projects?**
A: Use project tags. All projects can live in "Work" folder.

## The Anti-Rules

**Don't:**
- ‚ùå Spend more than 30 seconds capturing
- ‚ùå Create sub-folders
- ‚ùå Use more than 2 tags per item
- ‚ùå Write long notes
- ‚ùå Organize "later" (organize now, quickly)

**Do:**
- ‚úÖ Capture immediately
- ‚úÖ Keep it simple
- ‚úÖ Trust search
- ‚úÖ Use it consistently

## Results You Can Expect

**After 1 week:**
- Capturing becomes automatic
- 30-second ritual is effortless
- Finding things is faster than before

**After 1 month:**
- 100+ sources organized
- Zero time spent on "organization"
- Everything findable in seconds

**After 3 months:**
- System is invisible (good thing)
- Research is faster
- More time for actual work

## When to Upgrade Your System

**Stick with 5-Minute System if:**
- You save 10 sources per week
- You work on 1-3 projects at a time
- Quick and simple is your priority

**Consider more complexity if:**
- You save 50+ sources per week
- You manage 10+ simultaneous projects
- You need team collaboration
- You're doing academic research

**Even then, keep it simple. More complexity ‚â† better results.**

## Your Action Plan

**Today (5 minutes):**
1. Install PageStash
2. Create 3 folders
3. Define 5 tags
4. Save your first source

**This Week:**
- Capture 10 sources
- Practice 30-second ritual
- Trust the system

**Next Week:**
- Do 5-minute Friday review
- Refine your 5 tags if needed
- Keep using it

**That's it. Simple. Fast. Effective.**
