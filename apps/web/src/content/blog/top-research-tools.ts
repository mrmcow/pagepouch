## Choosing the Right Tool

### For Academic Researchers:
**Primary**: Zotero (citations + references)
**Secondary**: PagePouch (web content)
**Notes**: Obsidian or Notion

### For Market Analysts:
**Primary**: PagePouch (competitive intelligence)
**Secondary**: Notion (team collaboration)

### For Journalists:
**Primary**: PagePouch (source archiving)
**Secondary**: Evernote (interview notes)

### For Casual Users:
**Primary**: Pocket (reading)
**Secondary**: Raindrop.io (bookmarks)

### For Students:
**Primary**: Notion (notes + organization)
**Secondary**: PagePouch (research materials)

## The Multi-Tool Approach

Most productive researchers use 2-3 tools:
- One for web capture (PagePouch)
- One for notes (Obsidian, Notion)
- One specialized (Zotero for academics)

Don't try to force one tool to do everything.

## Migration Considerations

Switching tools is painful but sometimes worth it:
- Export your data before canceling
- Most tools support HTML or markdown export
- Start fresh if historical data isn't critical
- Run tools in parallel for one month before committing

## The Real Cost

Consider:
- Subscription fees
- Time spent learning
- Time spent organizing
- Opportunity cost of poor tools

Cheap tools that waste your time are expensive. Expensive tools that save hours are cheap.

## Try Before You Commit

All these tools offer free trials or free tiers:
1. Sign up for 2-3 that match your needs
2. Use them with real work for 1-2 weeks
3. Track which you actually use
4. Commit to one, cancel the rest

## Our Recommendation

For web content research (our focus):
1. **PagePouch** - Best specialized tool
2. **DEVONthink** - If you're Mac-only and budget allows
3. **Evernote** - If you need comprehensive productivity

For other use cases, combinations vary.
