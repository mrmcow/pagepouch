# Building a Second Brain: Web Edition

Tiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain" revolutionized personal knowledge management. Here's how to apply those principles specifically to web content.

## The Promise of a Second Brain

Your brain is for having ideas, not storing them. A second brain captures, organizes, and surfaces knowledge exactly when you need it—especially web content.

## The Four Stages: CODE

### Capture

Everything interesting goes into your system:
- Research articles
- News that matters
- Technical documentation
- Industry insights
- Competitor analysis

With PagePouch, click the extension button and the full page is saved instantly—no copy-pasting, no losing formatting.

### Organize

Don't organize by source or topic. Organize by actionability using PARA:

**Projects**: Active work (next 3 months)
**Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities
**Resources**: Topics of interest
**Archive**: Completed or inactive

### Distill

The web throws information at you. Your job is to extract wisdom.

**Progressive Summarization**:
1. Save the full page
2. Highlight key passages on first read
3. Bold the crucial sentences
4. Write a summary in your own words

Each layer makes future retrieval faster.

### Express

Knowledge unused is knowledge wasted. Your second brain should fuel creation:
- Writing
- Presentations
- Decision-making
- Teaching

## Web-Specific Strategies

### URL Rot is Real

Websites disappear, get paywalled, or change. Capture the full page, not just the bookmark.

### Context Matters

Add notes when you save: "For Q2 marketing deck" or "Counterargument to our approach"—helps future you understand why it mattered.

### Link Your Thinking

Connect related pages. PagePouch's knowledge graphs do this automatically, showing how your saved content relates.

## The Collection Habit

Set aside specific times for collection:
- Morning: Industry news (15 min)
- Afternoon: Project research (as needed)
- Friday: Week's best finds (10 min)

Avoid all-day distraction. Batch your capture.

## The Review Ritual

**Weekly Review** (30 min):
- Process what you captured
- Move to proper PARA categories
- Highlight key insights
- Connect to existing knowledge

**Monthly Review** (90 min):
- Archive completed projects
- Identify patterns in your captures
- Clean up quick-capture items
- Celebrate what you've built

## From Collection to Creation

Your second brain should make creating easier:

**Writing**: Full-text search finds exactly the quote you need
**Research**: Knowledge graphs reveal connections you missed
**Learning**: Spaced repetition of key insights
**Decisions**: All relevant context in one place

## The Tools That Work

**For text**: Obsidian, Notion, Roam
**For web content**: PagePouch
**Together**: Capture full pages with PagePouch, extract key insights to your note-taking tool, link between both

## Common Mistakes

**Over-organizing**: Don't spend more time organizing than creating
**Hoarding**: If you never reference it, delete it
**Perfectionism**: Done is better than perfect
**Not reviewing**: Without review, it's just a pile of stuff

## Start Simple

Week 1:
- Set up PARA folders
- Start capturing to Inbox
- Weekly review on Friday

Week 2-4:
- Add progressive summarization
- Connect related items
- Start creating from your system

Month 2:
- Implement knowledge graphs
- Refine your capture habits
- Measure your creative output

## The Compound Effect

One good article today seems insignificant. But 500 great articles, summarized and connected, become a competitive advantage.

Your second brain grows in value over time. The question is: when will you start?

PagePouch gives you the foundation: full-page capture, instant search, automatic knowledge graphs, and organization built for scale.
