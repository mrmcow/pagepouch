# PageStash Implementation Plan

## üéØ Vision & Mission

**Mission**: Create the most frictionless way for analysts and knowledge workers to capture, organize, and retrieve web content with perfect fidelity.

**Vision**: PageStash becomes the go-to tool for threat intelligence analysts, researchers, and knowledge workers who need to reliably archive web content with zero friction and maximum searchability.

**Core Values**:
- **Simplicity First**: One-click capture, zero configuration overhead
- **Perfect Fidelity**: What you see is exactly what gets saved
- **Instant Retrieval**: Find anything you've saved in seconds
