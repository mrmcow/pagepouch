# Reddit Moderation Issues - Troubleshooting & Alternatives

**Why posts get blocked and what to do instead**

---

## 🚨 **WHY POSTS GET BLOCKED**

### **Common Reasons:**

1. **Low Karma Account**
   - Many subs require 50-500+ karma
   - New accounts flagged as spam
   - AutoMod removes automatically

2. **Self-Promotion Rules**
   - Most subs ban direct product promotion
   - Links to your own site = instant removal
   - Even mentioning your product name can trigger

3. **Account Age**
   - Many subs require 30-90 day old accounts
   - New accounts = spam risk
   - Can't bypass this

4. **Link Posting**
   - Links in posts often auto-removed
   - Even in comments sometimes
   - Domain-specific blocks

5. **Pattern Detection**
   - Posting similar content to multiple subs
   - Using same account for all posts
   - Looks like spam campaign

---

## 🔍 **DIAGNOSTIC: Which Subs Blocked You?**

### **Tell me:**
1. Which subreddits removed your posts?
2. Did you get a mod message? (paste it if so)
3. How old is your Reddit account?
4. What's your karma score?
5. Did you include links in the post?

**This will determine the fix.**

---

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE FIXES**

### **Fix 1: Build Karma First (2-3 Days)**

**Before posting about PageStash:**

**Day 1-2: Comment on posts in your target subs**
- r/SideProject: Comment on 10 other projects
- r/GradSchool: Comment on 5 questions/discussions
- r/PKM: Engage with 5 PKM discussions
- Give genuine, helpful feedback
- **Goal: 50-100 karma**

**Day 3: Post**
- Now you're an "established" member
- Less likely to be auto-removed
- Looks less like spam

---

### **Fix 2: No Links in Post (Critical)**

**Instead of:**
```
Made PageStash:
- Saves full pages
- Search works
- Graph view

https://pagestash.app

Questions?
```

**Do this:**
```
Made a bookmark manager with graph view for research.

- Saves full pages
- Search works  
- Graph shows connections

Free Chrome & Firefox extensions. Link in profile if interested.

Questions about the approach?
```

**Then:**
- Add link to your Reddit profile bio
- Users can find it if interested
- Not "self-promotion" in post

---

### **Fix 3: Different Accounts for Different Subs**

**Why:**
- Pattern detection looks for spam
- Same account posting to 10 subs = ban
- Multiple accounts = looks organic

**Strategy:**
- Account 1: r/SideProject, r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur
- Account 2: r/GradSchool, r/PhD, r/AskAcademia  
- Account 3: r/PKM, r/ObsidianMD, r/Notion

**Each account:**
- Build karma separately
- Different posting patterns
- Different voice/style

**Note:** Reddit technically discourages this, but it's common practice.

---

### **Fix 4: Ask Mods First**

**Message moderators BEFORE posting:**

```
Subject: Question about sharing a tool I built

Hi mods,

I built a research tool (bookmark manager with knowledge graphs) that 
might be useful to this community. 

Is it okay to share here? I want to respect sub rules and contribute 
genuinely, not spam.

Happy to post in a specific thread or format if that's preferred.

Thanks!
```

**Many mods will:**
- Approve in advance
- Tell you how to post (e.g., "Saturday Show-off thread")
- Appreciate you asking
- Pre-approve so AutoMod doesn't remove

---

## 🎯 **REDDIT ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES**

### **Strategy A: Comment, Don't Post**

**Instead of creating posts, comment on existing threads:**

**Example - r/GradSchool:**

Someone posts: "How do you organize your lit review sources?"

**Your comment:**
```
I had this problem too - ended up building a tool for it.

Saves web pages with full-text search + graph view to see connections. 

Not perfect but better than folders for me. Happy to share if useful, 
don't want to spam the thread though.
```

**If they ask:**
```
Sure! It's called PageStash - Chrome/Firefox extension. 
Free tier for students. [link in my profile if mods allow]
```

**Why this works:**
- Answering their question genuinely
- Not self-promotion (responding to request)
- More likely to be allowed
- Higher conversion (targeted interest)

---

### **Strategy B: Show Off Threads**

**Many subs have designated promotional threads:**

| Subreddit | Thread | When |
|-----------|--------|------|
| r/SideProject | Show Off Saturday | Weekly |
| r/Entrepreneur | Mega Thread | Weekly |
| r/SaaS | Self-Promotion Saturday | Weekly |
| r/startups | Share Your Startup | Monthly |

**Post ONLY in these threads:**
- Explicitly allowed
- Won't be removed
- Lower engagement but safer

---

### **Strategy C: Ask for Feedback (Not Promotion)**

**Frame as seeking help, not promoting:**

**Title:**
```
Feedback requested: Building a research tool with knowledge graphs
```

**Body:**
```
Working on a bookmark manager for academic research. Key feature is 
graph view showing how sources connect.

Would this be useful? What features matter most for lit reviews?

[Screenshot of graph view]

Not launching yet, genuinely seeking feedback from researchers.
```

**Why this works:**
- Not self-promotion
- Asking for help (communities love this)
- Can mention your tool without being salesy
- Include link in comments if asked

---

## 🚫 **WHAT PROBABLY WON'T WORK**

### **❌ Don't Try:**

1. **Creating new accounts to evade bans**
   - Reddit tracks this (IP, browser fingerprint)
   - Gets you site-wide banned
   - Not worth it

2. **Arguing with mods**
   - They have final say
   - Will ban you permanently
   - Hurts your reputation

3. **Posting same content to 10+ subs**
   - Pattern detection flags you
   - Looks like spam
   - Gets you shadow banned

4. **Using URL shorteners**
   - Auto-blocked by most subs
   - Looks like spam
   - Just don't

5. **Editing posts to add links later**
   - Mods catch this
   - Permanent ban
   - Not worth it

---

## 💡 **BETTER APPROACH: Focus on High-Value, Low-Volume**

### **Instead of 30 subreddits, focus on 3-5 HIGH-QUALITY posts**

**Week 1:**
- r/SideProject (Saturday Show-off thread)
- Message mods first
- Build karma by commenting
- ONE post, done well

**Week 2:**
- r/PKM (ask mods permission first)
- Comment on 10 posts first
- Post with no links (link in profile)

**Week 3:**
- r/GradSchool (comment-based strategy)
- Find relevant questions
- Answer genuinely
- Mention tool if asked

**Result:**
- 3-5 successful posts vs 30 blocked posts
- Higher quality engagement
- No bans or removals
- Better ROI

## 🔄 **ALTERNATIVE CHANNELS (Better ROI Than Reddit)**

### **If Reddit isn't working, pivot to these:**

**1. Product Hunt (Launch Day)**
- One-time launch
- High visibility
- Expected: 200-500 upvotes, 100-300 signups
- Preparation: 2 weeks
- Effort: High upfront, then done

**2. Hacker News (Show HN)**
- "Show HN: Bookmark manager with knowledge graphs"
- Can get 500+ upvotes if good
- Expected: 1,000-5,000 visitors, 100-200 signups
- Timing: Tuesday-Thursday 9-11am EST
- Strict community rules but worth it

**3. Extension Stores (Already Done)**
- Chrome Web Store: 100-500 installs/month organic
- Firefox Add-ons: 50-150 installs/month organic
- Zero promotion needed
- Already submitted

**4. Directory Listings (Already Started)**
- AlternativeTo (done)
- SaaSHub (done)
- Capterra (next)
- G2 (next)
- Expected: 50-150 signups/month combined

**5. Content/SEO (Long-term)**
- Your blog posts already ranking
- Expected: 100-300 visitors/month organic
- Compounds over time
- Zero ongoing effort

**6. Email Outreach**
- Reach out to PKM newsletter writers
- Reach out to academic tool reviewers
- Reach out to productivity bloggers
- Ask for feature/review
- Expected: 2-3 responses, 1 feature = 500-1000 visitors

**7. Twitter/X**
- Post about building in public
- Share progress updates
- #buildinpublic hashtag
- Expected: Slow growth but consistent

## 📊 **EFFORT vs IMPACT COMPARISON**

| Channel | Effort | Risk | Expected Signups | Verdict |
|---------|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| Reddit organic | High | High (bans) | 50-100 (if works) | ⚠️ Risky |
| Product Hunt | Medium | Low | 100-300 | ✅ Do this |
| Hacker News | Low | Low | 100-200 | ✅ Do this |
| Extension Stores | None | None | 100-500/month | ✅ Already done |
| Directories | Low | None | 50-150/month | ✅ Continue |
| Content/SEO | Medium | None | 100-300/month | ✅ Continue |
| Email Outreach | Medium | Low | Variable | ✅ Worth trying |

**Verdict: Reddit is high-effort, high-risk, medium-reward. Other channels are better.**

## 📧 **EMAIL OUTREACH TEMPLATE**

**Subject:** Feature request - New PKM tool for web content

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm a long-time reader of [Newsletter/Blog]. Love your coverage of PKM tools.

I built PageStash - a bookmark manager with knowledge graphs, 
specifically for web content (articles, docs, GitHub pages).

Different from note-taking tools - it's for archival + seeing 
connections between saved web pages.

Would you be interested in reviewing it? Happy to give you a free 
Pro account and answer any questions.

Either way, keep up the great work on [Newsletter/Blog]!

Best,
Michael

pagestash.app
```

**Send to:**
- Forte Labs (Tiago Forte - PKM expert)
- Ness Labs (Anne-Laure Le Cunff)
- Tool Finder newsletters
- ProductHunt Daily Digest curators
- Indie Hackers newsletter

**Expected:** 20% response rate, 1-2 features = 500-1,000 visitors each

## ✅ **YOUR NEW ACTION PLAN**

### **Abandon Reddit organic (for now). Do this instead:**

**Tuesday (This Week):**
- [ ] Post "Show HN" to Hacker News (10am EST)
- [ ] Monitor comments, respond quickly
- [ ] Track signups

**Wednesday-Friday:**
- [ ] Email 10 newsletter writers (use template above)
- [ ] Add PageStash to 3 more directories (Capterra, G2, Slant)
- [ ] Prepare Product Hunt launch assets

**Next Week:**
- [ ] Review HN results
- [ ] Follow up with newsletter writers who responded
- [ ] Continue directory submissions

**In 2 Weeks:**
- [ ] Launch on Product Hunt (Tuesday)
- [ ] Promote to email list + Twitter
- [ ] Aim for top 5 products of the day

**Result: 200-500 signups in 30 days, zero Reddit moderation issues.**

## 🤔 **WHEN TO RETRY REDDIT**

**Wait until:**
1. ✅ Your Reddit account has 500+ karma
2. ✅ Account is 3+ months old
3. ✅ You have social proof (Product Hunt badge, testimonials)
4. ✅ You can post without links (link in profile)
5. ✅ You've messaged mods first

**Then retry with:**
- No links in posts
- "Feedback request" framing
- Commenting strategy
- Show-off threads only

---

## 💬 **QUESTIONS FOR YOU:**

1. **Which subreddits specifically removed your posts?**
   - Need to know if it's karma, links, or self-promotion rules

2. **What's your Reddit account karma/age?**
   - Determines if you can try again or need new approach

3. **Did you include links in posts?**
   - This is usually the killer

4. **Are you open to trying Hacker News instead?**
   - Much better ROI, less moderation

5. **Want help with Product Hunt launch?**
