**Title:**
```
Built PageStash - a web archival tool with knowledge graphs for researchers
```

**Body:**
```
[GIF: 15-second demo of capturing page → knowledge graph]

After losing bookmarks during my thesis, I spent 6 months building PageStash.

What it does: One-click web page archival + full-text search + visual knowledge graphs to see how your research connects.

Built for: Researchers, analysts, students, anyone drowning in bookmarks.

Free tier: 10 clips/month
Extensions: Chrome & Firefox
Link: pagestash.app

Would love feedback from fellow researchers! 👇
```

**Expected:** 200-500 upvotes, 30-50 comments

### **Template 2: r/InternetIsBeautiful**

**Title:**
```
This website creates a visual graph showing how your bookmarks connect
```

**Body:**
```
[Screenshot: Beautiful knowledge graph with annotations]

Found PageStash - it captures web pages and shows connections between them.

The knowledge graph feature is wild - it auto-detects relationships between saved pages (same source, same topic, content similarity) and visualizes them.

Built for researchers but works for anyone who saves lots of web content.

Free to try: pagestash.app
Extensions: Chrome & Firefox
```

**Expected:** 500-2000 upvotes, 100-200 comments

---

### **Template 3: r/productivity**

**Title:**
```
I built a bookmark manager that shows how your saved pages connect [Knowledge Graphs]
```

**Body:**
```
[GIF: Adding bookmarks → Graph builds automatically]

Problem: I had 500+ bookmarks in Chrome folders, impossible to see relationships.

Solution: PageStash captures pages AND creates knowledge graphs showing connections.

Game-changer for:
• Research projects
• Competitive analysis
• Content planning
• Learning new topics

Free tier: 10 clips/month
Try it: pagestash.app (Chrome & Firefox)

AMA about building this! 👇
```

**Expected:** 100-300 upvotes, 20-40 comments

PhD student here. Lost a ton of bookmarks, spent weeks re-finding sources.

Built PageStash:
✓ One-click capture (screenshot + text)
✓ Full-text search (find quotes instantly)
✓ Knowledge graphs (see how papers connect)
✓ Works offline

Designed for literature reviews, but useful for any research.

Free for students: 10 clips/month

### **Template 5: r/PKM (Personal Knowledge Management)**

**Title:**
```
Built a tool that creates knowledge graphs from web content [Obsidian-style]
```

**Body:**
```
[Screenshot: Knowledge graph with Obsidian comparison]

Long-time PKM enthusiast. Wanted Obsidian's graph view for web content.

PageStash does:
• Capture any web page (full-page screenshot + text)
• Auto-detect connections (same topic, source, content)
• Visual knowledge graph (like Obsidian's)
• Full-text search across everything

Works WITH your PKM system:
- Export to Markdown
- Sync with Notion/Obsidian
- API for custom workflows

Free tier: pagestash.app
Chrome & Firefox available

How do you manage web sources in your PKM? 👇
```

**Expected:** 100-250 upvotes, 30-60 comments (very engaged community)

## 💬 **COMMENT STRATEGY**

### **First Hour is CRITICAL:**

Reddit's algorithm favors posts with early engagement.

**Must-Do:**
1. **Pin a comment** with additional info:
```
Hey everyone! 👋 Creator here.

Quick FAQ:
• Free tier: 10 clips/month
• Extensions: Chrome & Firefox
• Privacy: Your data stays yours
• Export: Markdown, JSON available

Happy to answer questions! AMA 👇
```

2. **Respond to EVERY comment** in first hour
3. **Be humble, not salesy**
4. **Give away promo codes** if asked

---

### **Common Questions & Your Responses:**

**Q: "How is this different from Pocket/Instapaper?"**
```
Great question! Main differences:
1. Full-page screenshot (not just article text)
2. Knowledge graph to see connections
3. Built for researchers (full-text search, folders, tags)
4. Privacy-first (no tracking)

Pocket is great for reading later. PageStash is for research/reference.
```

**Q: "What's the business model?"**
```
Freemium:
• Free: 10 clips/month
• Pro: $12/month for 1,000 clips + 5GB storage

No ads, no data selling. Straightforward pricing.
```

**Q: "Is this open source?"**
```
Extensions are free and available on Chrome/Firefox stores.
Backend is proprietary, but considering open-sourcing parts.

Would open source be important to you?
```

**Q: "Can I self-host?"**
```
Not yet, but it's on the roadmap!
For now, all your data is exportable (Markdown, JSON).

Would self-hosting be a dealbreaker for you?
```
