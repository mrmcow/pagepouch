## 📝 **SUBREDDIT-SPECIFIC COPY**

### **TIER 1: Launch-Friendly (Start Here)**

---

#### **1. r/SideProject** (202K) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Why:** Most friendly to launches, builder community, high engagement

**Rules to check:**
- ✅ Allowed: Sharing projects
- ⚠️ Don't: Ask for feedback in title (they have Show Off Saturday)
- ⚠️ Use flair: "Launching" or "Show Off"

**Post Copy:**

**Title:**
```
Built a bookmark manager with graph view. Sharing in case useful.
```

**Body:**
```
Lost bookmarks during my thesis. Made PageStash to fix it.

- Saves full pages with one click  
- Search actually works
- Shows connections via graph view

Not perfect but works better than folders for research.

Chrome & Firefox: https://pagestash.app

Happy to answer questions or hear feedback.
```

**Expected:** 100-300 upvotes, 30-60 comments, 500-1500 visitors, 25-50 signups

#### **2. r/PKM** (40K) - HIGHEST ENGAGEMENT

**Why:** Personal knowledge management enthusiasts, perfect audience, highly engaged

**Rules to check:**
- ✅ Allowed: Sharing tools
- ⚠️ Be helpful, not promotional
- ✅ Engage in comments

**Post Copy:**

**Title:**
```
Made a tool for web content that didn't fit my PKM system
```

**Body:**
```
Got a good PKM setup (Notion for notes, Obsidian for thinking), but web content was still a mess. Browser bookmarks weren't cutting it.

Made PageStash:
- Captures full pages with one click
- Full-text search like Notion
- Graph view like Obsidian
- Exports to Markdown

Doesn't replace your PKM system, just handles web archival better than bookmarks.

https://pagestash.app (Chrome & Firefox)

How do you all handle web content in your systems?
```

**Expected:** 50-150 upvotes, 20-40 comments, 300-800 visitors, 30-60 signups (high conversion)

- ✅ Must be genuinely helpful

**Post Copy:**

**Title:**
```
Lost 200+ sources during my lit review. Made a tool so it wouldn't happen again.
```

```
Had to re-find papers I'd already read. Chrome bookmarks weren't cutting it, Zotero was for PDFs not web pages.

Made PageStash:
- Captures full web pages with one click
- Search works across everything
- Graph view shows how sources connect

Still improving it, but search and archival are solid. Free tier if you want to try.

https://pagestash.app (Chrome & Firefox)

Fellow grad students - how do you manage web sources?
```

**Expected:** 80-200 upvotes, 30-50 comments, 400-1000 visitors, 40-80 signups

- ✅ Markdown export is key

**Post Copy:**

**Title:**
```
Made a graph view for web bookmarks (Obsidian user here)
```

**Body:**
```
Love Obsidian's graph, wanted something similar for web content I save.

PageStash:
- Save pages with browser extension

- Shows as graph view (similar to Obsidian)
- Export to Markdown

Works alongside your vault, not instead of it. Thought this community might find it useful.

https://pagestash.app (Chrome & Firefox)

```

**Expected:** 60-150 upvotes, 25-40 comments, 300-700 visitors, 30-50 signups

```

```
500 bookmarks. 60 tabs. Pocket list at 1,000+. Can't find anything when I need it.

Made PageStash to fix this:

For people who save things they'll need later, not just read once.

Not replacing Zotero, just handling web content that doesn't fit.

**Angle:** Web clipper for Notion users

**Title:**
```
Made a web clipper that works well with Notion

```
Notion's web clipper is okay but doesn't save full pages. Made PageStash to handle this.

- Saves full page with one click
- Full-text search (like Notion)
- Graph view for connections
- Export to Markdown for Notion

Doesn't replace Notion, just better for archiving web content.

## 📋 **PRE-POST CHECKLIST**

Before posting to ANY subreddit:

- [ ] Read subreddit rules (sidebar/wiki)
- [ ] Check if tool sharing is allowed
- [ ] Search sub for "bookmark manager" or similar to see what's allowed
- [ ] Add UTM code: `?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=[subreddit-name]`
- [ ] Schedule time to respond to comments (first 2 hours critical)
- [ ] Have FAQ ready (pricing, privacy, features)
- [ ] 24 hours since last Reddit post

---

## 💬 **UNIVERSAL FAQ (Copy/Paste Responses)**

**Q: "Is this open source?"**
```
Extensions are free, backend is proprietary. Your data exports work (Markdown, JSON) so you're not locked in. Considering open-sourcing parts - would that be important to you?
```

**Q: "How is this different from Pocket/Instapaper?"**
```
Pocket's great for reading. PageStash is more for archiving pages you'll search/reference later. Main difference: saves full page + shows connections via graph.
```

**Q: "What's the pricing?"**
```
Free: 10 clips/month (permanent)
Pro: $12/month for 1,000 clips + 5GB storage

No ads, no data selling.
```

**Q: "Can I self-host?"**
```
Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. Data exports work now (Markdown, JSON) so you can take your data anytime. Would self-hosting be a dealbreaker for you?
```

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
```
Freemium - free tier is 10 clips/month. Pro is $12/month if you need more storage/clips. No ads or data selling.
```

**Q: "Yet another bookmark manager..."**
```
Totally fair. Main difference is the graph view - helped me see connections I missed when stuff was in folders. If bookmarks work for you, no reason to switch.
```
