- ❌ Asking for backlink in first email (provide value first)

## 📈 **Tracking Template:**

Create a simple spreadsheet with these columns:

| Date | Source | Type | URL | Status | DA | Traffic | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-----|--------|----|---------| ------|
| 11/12 | ResearchGate | Profile | link | Live | 92 | TBD | - |
| 11/12 | awesome-research | GitHub | link | Pending | 96 | TBD | PR #123 |
| 11/13 | Dev.to | Article | link | Live | 90 | 15 | Good engagement |

---

## ✅ **Daily Habits (10-15 min/day):**

- **Morning:** Check HARO emails, respond to 1 relevant query
- **Lunch:** Respond to 1 Reddit post or Quora question
- **Evening:** Track backlinks acquired, update spreadsheet
