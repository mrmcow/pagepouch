### Curiosity-Driven CTAs:

Each post ends with pattern/insight revelation:

**OSINT post:**
> "The difference between good OSINT and great OSINT isn't just finding sources—it's seeing how they connect. Most investigators miss patterns because they're buried in folders. But when you visualize 100+ sources as a graph? The invisible becomes obvious."

**Academic post:**
> "With 400+ sources in folders, you can't see the forest for the trees. Knowledge graphs make the invisible visible. The 200 web sources you've already captured? They tell a story. You just need the right view to see it."

**PKM post:**
> "You've saved 300 articles, tutorials, and resources. In browser folders, you see: What's in each folder. In a knowledge graph, you see: The 10 sources you reference most often, the 5 concepts that appear everywhere, the connections between design, development, and marketing sources."

**These CTAs:**
- Don't hard-sell
- Create curiosity gap
- Promise insight/revelation
- Encourage "just try it" behavior
