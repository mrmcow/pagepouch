## 🎤 **Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)**

**For networking, podcasts, or quick descriptions:**

```
"I built PageStash after spending years as a researcher frustrated 
with bookmarks and note-taking tools.

It's a browser extension that captures full web pages - screenshot, 
text, metadata - with one click. Everything's searchable and you can 
visualize connections between your research using knowledge graphs.

Think Pocket meets Obsidian, but designed specifically for research 
workflows.

We have 10,000 users now - mostly grad students, analysts, and 
journalists who need to organize large amounts of web content."
