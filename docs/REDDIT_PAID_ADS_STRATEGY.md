# Reddit Paid Ads Strategy for PageStash

**Subtle, native-feeling ad copy for targeted subreddit campaigns**

---

## 📌 **THE GENUINE APPROACH**

**Key Philosophy: Sound like a person, not a brand.**

All copy in this doc follows these principles:
- ✅ Casual, honest language ("kinda", "honestly", "not perfect")
- ✅ Admit limitations ("still improving it")
- ✅ No hype or marketing buzzwords
- ✅ Respect user skepticism ("totally fair")
- ✅ Share, don't sell ("might help yours")

**What we avoid:**
- ❌ Forced excitement or emojis
- ❌ "Game-changer", "revolutionary", "amazing"
- ❌ Social proof inflation
- ❌ Overselling features

**Result:** Higher trust, better engagement, lower ad resistance.

---

## 🎯 **Reddit Ads Overview**

### **Why Reddit Ads Work for SaaS:**

- **93% of Redditors** say they come to Reddit to research products
- **High intent audience** - actively seeking solutions
- **Native format** - ads look like organic posts
- **Precise targeting** - down to specific subreddits
- **Lower CPC** than Facebook/Google ($0.50-$2.00 vs $3-$5)

### **Ad Format We'll Use: Promoted Posts**

**Why this format:**
- Looks exactly like organic posts
- Appears in feed naturally
- Can be upvoted/downvoted (social proof)
- Allows comments (engagement)
- Text + image/GIF

**NOT using:**
- Display banners (too promotional)
- Video ads (high production cost)
- Conversation ads (intrusive)

---

## 💰 **Budget Recommendations**

### **Test Budget (First 30 Days):**

| Campaign Type | Budget | Expected Results |
|---------------|--------|------------------|
| **Tier 1 Test** | $500 | 5,000-10,000 impressions, 50-150 clicks, 5-15 signups |
| **Tier 2 Scale** | $1,500 | 20,000-40,000 impressions, 200-500 clicks, 20-50 signups |
| **Tier 3 Full** | $3,000+ | 50,000+ impressions, 500-1,500 clicks, 50-150 signups |

**Recommendation:** Start with $500 test across 3-5 subreddits

### **Expected Metrics:**

- **CPM** (Cost per 1000 impressions): $3-$8
- **CPC** (Cost per click): $0.50-$2.00
- **CTR** (Click-through rate): 1-3%

## 📝 **AD COPY TEMPLATES**

### **The Reddit Ad Formula:**

```
[HONEST HOOK - casual, not clickbait]

```

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Sound like a real person, not a brand
- ✅ Be honest about limitations
- ✅ Use casual language ("kinda", "honestly", "idk")
- ✅ Show, don't sell
- ✅ Admit when it's not for everyone
- ❌ NO forced excitement or emojis
- ❌ NO marketing buzzwords
- ❌ NO "game-changer", "revolutionary", etc.

For people who save things they'll need later, not just read once.

## 🎨 **CREATIVE ASSETS (Low-Effort)**

### **Option 1: Text-Only Post (Fastest)**

**Format:** Plain text promoted post
**Effort:** 5 minutes
**Cost:** $0
**Performance:** 70% effectiveness vs. image

**Use when:**
- Testing new copy quickly
- Want maximum native feel
- Targeting text-heavy communities (r/PhD, r/AskAcademia)

---

### **Option 2: Simple Screenshot (Recommended)**

**Format:** Text + single screenshot
**Effort:** 10 minutes
**Cost:** $0
**Performance:** 100% baseline

**What to include:**
- Knowledge graph screenshot (most eye-catching)
- Or dashboard with organized clips
- Or before/after comparison

**Keep it:**
- Clean (no clutter)
- Readable (no tiny text)
- Native (doesn't scream "ad")

---

### **Option 3: Minimal Graphic (If Needed)**

**Format:** Text + simple branded image
**Effort:** 15 minutes (Canva)
**Cost:** $0
**Performance:** 85% effectiveness (can look too "ad-like")

**Template:**
```
[Background: Simple gradient or solid color]
[Text overlay: Single pain point or benefit]
[Small logo in corner]
[Minimal design]
```

**Use sparingly** - text + screenshot performs better

## 💬 **HANDLING AD COMMENTS**

### **Reddit ads allow comments - use this!**

**DO:**
- ✅ Respond to every comment within 2 hours
- ✅ Be helpful, not salesy
- ✅ Offer free tier or promo code
- ✅ Ask questions back
- ✅ Admit limitations honestly

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Ignore negative feedback
- ❌ Be defensive
- ❌ Give copy-paste responses
- ❌ Argue with trolls

---

### **Response Templates:**

**Comment: "This looks interesting! Is it really free?"**
```
Yeah, 10 clips/month free. No card needed.

Pro is $12/month if you need more, but free tier works fine for testing.
```

**Comment: "How is this different from Pocket?"**
```
Pocket's great for reading. PageStash is more for archiving pages you'll search later.

Main difference: saves full page content + shows connections via graph.

Depends what you need - reading vs. research reference.
```

**Comment: "Yet another bookmark manager... 🙄"**
```
Totally fair. 

Main difference for me was the graph view - helped see connections I missed when stuff was in folders.

If bookmarks work for you though, no reason to switch.
```

**Comment: "Is this open source?"**
```
Not yet. Extensions are free, backend is proprietary.

Data exports work (Markdown, JSON) so you're not locked in.

Would open source matter to you?
```
