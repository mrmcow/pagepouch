Thank you for your interest in contributing to PageStash! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Process

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork
2. **Follow the setup guide** in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`
3. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
4. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
5. **Test thoroughly** before submitting
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements

Examples:
- `feature/advanced-search`

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Formatting, no code change
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test` - Adding missing tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feat(extension): add full-page screenshot capture`
